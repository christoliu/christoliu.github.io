A classic train journey from London Kings Cross to Edinburgh Waverley.

## Part 1: London (Days 1-4)

We stayed near **Covent Garden**.

## Part 2: The Train

The LNER train ride was smooth. The coastal views near Newcastle were stunning.

## Part 3: Edinburgh (Days 5-8)

The city feels like Harry Potter world.

1.  Hiked up **Arthur's Seat** (Very windy!)
2.  Edinburgh Castle
3.  Whisky tasting on the Royal Mile

> "The vibe in Edinburgh is unmatched."
