# Relaxing Weekend Getaway

This trip was unplanned and spontaneous. We just wanted to escape Taipei for a bit.

## Saturday: Hot Springs

We arrived in Jiaoxi around noon.

*   Lunch at a local scallion pancake shop.
*   Check-in at the hot spring hotel.
*   Dinner at the night market.

## Sunday: Nature

1.  Morning hike at **Linmei Shipan Trail**.
2.  Coffee by the rice fields.
3.  Drive back to Taipei before the traffic jam.
