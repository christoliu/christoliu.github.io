# Mountains Calling

There is something magical about the air in Switzerland. It's so clean it almost hurts.

We based ourselves in **Grindelwald**, right at the foot of the Eiger North Face.

## The First Hike: First to Bachalpsee

This is the "easy" hike, but the views are world-class. The reflection of the peaks in Lake Bachalpsee is iconic. We packed a sandwich lunch (Coop supermarket is a lifesaver given Swiss prices) and ate by the water.

### Cows Everywhere

Yes, they really do wear bells. The sound of cowbells ringing through the valley is the soundtrack of the Alps.

> Tip: Buy the Swiss Travel Pass if you plan to take trains and cable cars. It pays for itself very quickly.
