# A Day in Kyoto

The air was crisp as we started our walk up to **Kiyomizu-dera**. The autumn colors were just starting to show, turning the hillsides into a patchwork of red and gold.

## Fushimi Inari

Later in the afternoon, we went to the famous gates. We decided to hike all the way to the top of the mountain.

### Highlights
*   Thousands of torii gates
*   Fox statues everywhere
*   Amazing sunset view from the Yotsutsuji intersection

It was a long hike, but absolutely worth it for the udon noodles we had at the bottom.

We finished the day with some matcha ice cream near the station.
